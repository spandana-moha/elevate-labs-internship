Day 02 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
ðŸ“Œ Task Objective Understand data using statistics and visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.

ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Titanic Dataset from Kaggle

ðŸ“‹ Steps Followed
- Generated summary statistics using ".describe()" to explore central tendencies and spread
- Plotted histograms and boxplots for key numerical features like Age and Fare
- Used correlation matrix and pairplots to explore relationships between features
- Analyzed categorical vs target variable (e.g., Sex vs Survived, Pclass vs Survived)
- Identified patterns and anomalies such as outliers and skewed distributions
- Drew insights based on feature-level analysis

ðŸ§  Insights Gained
- Survival rate was significantly higher among females and first-class passengers.
- Fare showed a positive correlation with survival, suggesting wealthier passengers had better outcomes.
- Age had no strong correlation with survival but revealed some interesting age distributions.
- Outliers in Fare were detected and could affect modeling if left unhandled.
